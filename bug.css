The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

#myElement {
  width: 100%;
}

.container #myElement {
  width: 75%; /* This rule is unexpectedly ignored */
}
```

In this scenario, we would expect the element with the id `myElement` inside an element with the class `container` to have a width of 75%. However, due to the way CSS specificity works, the rule with `#myElement` overrides the more specific rule `container #myElement`. This is because the ID selector (`#myElement`) has higher specificity than the combination of class and ID selector.

This behavior might be unexpected for developers not fully understanding the nuances of CSS specificity.
