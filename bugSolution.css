To solve this issue, we can improve the specificity of the more specific rule by using a more specific selector that has a higher precedence than the `#myElement` selector. One way to achieve this is by adding another class to the inner element and referencing that in the CSS rule. Alternatively, you could also modify your HTML structure and add more specific classes. For example:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

#myElement {
  width: 100%;
}

.container .inner {
  width: 75%;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div id="myElement" class="inner">
    This element should have a width of 75% now.
  </div>
</div>
```

Now, the rule `.container .inner { width: 75%; }` has higher specificity due to the added class, correctly applying the width. By understanding and leveraging class selectors, we can avoid unexpected overrides and ensure our styles are applied as intended.
